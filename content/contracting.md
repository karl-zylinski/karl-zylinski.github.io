_I can help you improve your game engine and and its tools._ I offer:

- World-class expertise in creating game engine tools, especially with Immediate Mode UIs.
- A great low-level understanding of game engines, data models and content pipelines.
- The ability to identify and fix performance bottlenecks.
- Proficiency in Odin, C, C++, C#, shader languages and Python.
- A very friendly attitude.

I am interested in part-time contracts (up to 24 hours per week). I can work remotely or in the Stockholm / Uppsala area of Sweden.

Tell me about your needs by sending me an e-mail: [karl@zylinski.se](mailto:karl@zylinski.se).
