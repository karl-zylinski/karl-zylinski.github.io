The format is one-on-one video call with possibility of screen share.

- Teaching game development concepts

## My special skills

- **Teaching basic Odin concepts in an in-depth way:** See my YouTube channel for examples of my teaching style: https://www.youtube.com/@karl_zylinski
- **Game development in a "from scratch" kind of way:** I have previously made the game [CAT & ONION](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2781210/CAT__ONION/) using Odin and Raylib.
- **Game tools programming:** I have knowledge on how to create game editor tools such as level editors from my time at [Our Machinery](https://ruby0x1.github.io/machinery_blog_archive/) and [Bitsquid](http://bitsquid.blogspot.com/).
- **Solo developing games:** Knowledge about what corners you can cut when working alone to speed up the process.
