Let me share some details on how I wrote the first book about the Odin Programming Language. It's a digital book called "Understanding the Odin Programming" language. It was released on December 6, 2024. The book is available on https://odinbook.com/

In this blog post I will share some "how I got started" stories as well as some technical things related to writing programming books. 

## A happy accident

Exactly how one gets started on a project varies. I didn't plan to write a book really. I just felt like writing an introductory blog post to Odin! I thought that it would be nice to put out something that is reader-friendly and also tries to highlight interesting things about the language.

The result of that is the blog post "Introduction to the Odin Programming Language". It took a few days to write. You can read it here: https://zylinski.se/posts/introduction-to-odin/

My creative projects often seem to start with some kind of "happy accident": Something small that leads to something bigger. I didn't know I had written the seed a whole book, and that I would be working on it for many months.

## Book ideas

Quite quickly after posting the blog post, I was already thinking about writing something bigger. Writing the blog post had come quite naturally to me, and I found it fun. I also [posted the blog post on Twitter](https://x.com/karl_zylinski/status/1799829568590950779), where people quickly noted that I should turn it into a book.

However, I wasn't sure what a book would mean. A physical book? An e-book? What's the target audience? What does it try to teach? Do I want to write a book?

What I quite quickly figured out was "What does it try to teach?". I've helped many beginners on the Odin Discord server (the official Odin chat) by answering their questions. I've noticed some questions that were hard to answer without explaining several separate ideas that were all key in giving intuition about how the language works. Some of these things were not covered in the official documentation, and if they were, there was often no "connection between the dots": You needed to spend a lot of time figuring things out by yourself and see how things were connected. So that's what I wanted to do: Bridge the gap between the online documentation and years of using Odin, hopefully saving the reader a lot of time.

When I had that figured out, I just started writing. The target audience I would refine over time, I wanted to try writing a few different chapters and see what style I wanted to go for. I hadn't yet decided on if I wanted a physical release, but I figured a digital release (some kind of e-book) would be good starting point regardless.

## The Tools of Writing

How does one write a digital book? What software do you use? How does the text become the e-book, or a physical book for that matter?

Early on, I reached out to Bob Nystrom, the author of "Crafting Interpreters". I was interested in his style, because he seemed to

I've been on the [Odin Discord](https://discord.gg/odinlang) (the official Odin chat). In there I often try to help people in the #beginners channel. Over time, I've noted some common questions. Some of those common questions are sometimes complicated to answer. Some answers require you to explain several separate concepts, in order give the person a good intuition. That's hard to do in a chat.

Many of these things I _had_ to explain in the chat, because there were no documentation online that was on a beginner's level that also "connected the dots" between the different concepts involved in answer a complicated questions.

So I thought that I should try to collect my ideas in a blog post! I just started writing out different things that I thought were unique about Odin and also tried to answer some of
